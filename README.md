# Guidelines
## 1) Create an HTML file named *index.html*
Use the **!DOCTYPE html** declaration at the beginning of the file to indicate that it's an HTML document.

## 2) Create a head section that includes a title element with the text "My Resume".

## 3) Inside the body section, write HTML code to create an online resume covering the following aspects:
- Summary or objective statement
- Education (list degrees, schools, and dates)
- Work experience (list job titles, employers, dates, and responsibilities)
- Skills (list relevant skills or areas of expertise)
- Awards, certifications, or other achievements (list any relevant awards, certifications, or other accomplishments)
- Use appropriate HTML tags to format the content of each section, such as h1 for section headings and ul or ol for lists.
- Use HTML tags to add a profile photo of yourself.

## 4) Use relevant anchor tags to create a multi-page website, listing other aspects of your resume such as Hobbies and Contact details.

## 5) Add a footer element with your name and any copyright information or other disclaimers.

## 6) Save the index.html file and open it in a web browser to ensure that it displays correctly.
